## Cross Platform Availability

Solutions should have native performance anywhere and everywhere.
This simplifies the design process and user experience to a minimum required, keeping our ideas close to the users at all times.

While our solutions are not IoT centric there is a great benefit for having services flexible across a wide variety of devices.

## End-to-End Encryption

We want to build ASAP solutions, that is software As Secure As Possible.
End-to-end encryption is a minimal overhead which becomes automated when implemented in every step of our workflow.

Compliance with ISO 27XXX has become quite necessary to turn around corporate clients but the necessity to create a company wide security standard exists without the need of business level recognition.

## Assisted Intelligence Analytics

While the concept of Artificial Intelligence is interesting human input is always required as they do not think for themselves.

A mix of machine learning and human pattern review is something we are actively aiming for. A/B testing has been proved to provide beneficial results and machine learning is just one of the means we are using to automate feature testing.

## Future Proofing

Software development has become very unstable with the high influx of new people learning "stuff" and the emerging hybrid specialisations of businesses into the TECH domain, being able to predict software and market development has become tedious and uncertain.

Most non-native code is a collage of open source dependencies to the point where in average 5% of common written code is _real_, the rest being a complex dependency tree.

In reality good software has a certain impact on technology, people and markets. Being able to observe these patterns we are able to make something called "safe decisions", minimising disaster chance and recovery downtime.

## Continuous Delivery

Zero downtime, zero stress.
