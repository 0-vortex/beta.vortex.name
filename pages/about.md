Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is TED Vortex, welcome to my secret hideout. ðŸš€

I am multi-faceted software engineer with over a decade experience building business critical applications and services and part time open source enthusiast.

Proficient in GitHub Actions, CloudFlare Workers, TypeScript, and React. Skilled with De/Node, Docker, and PostGres. I prioritize efficiency and practicality in my work. No fluff, just results.

In my day to day activities I employ various philosophical concepts, some of my favourite and most useful being: DRY, KISS, Occam's Razor and Zeno's paradoxes.

Currently learning LLMs and Decentralized Scaling. ðŸš§
